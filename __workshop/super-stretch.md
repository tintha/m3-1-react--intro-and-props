There are many different chat applications. Here's a screenshot of Google Hangouts chat:

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: take the lessons you've learned from creating iMessage, and use them to recreate this screenshot of Hangouts.

There are quite a few differences:

- There's a list of conversations on the left-hand sidebar. Our data file only has 1 conversation. You can choose to simply have a single conversation in the sidebar, or create more fake data
- A green bar along the top shows the current user's name, as well as the name of the chat (in this screenshot it's Marketing Team, but in your app, it could be a comma-separated list of the other participants)
- Totally different styling
- Photos can be part of messages

It's likely that you won't have time to make this a perfect clone, so feel free to focus on whichever elements you're most interestd in.

To get an initial setup, you can either:

- Clone the repository again, and use the fresh "workshop" folder
- Check out another git branch, and work in that branch
